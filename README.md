# RitvikGlobal Next.js Website

A clean, mobile friendly marketing website built with Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Deploy to Vercel

2. Import the repo in Vercel
3. Build command: `npm run build`

## Notes

- All content is stored locally in the code (no database).
- The Contact form uses a `mailto:` link so it works with zero backend. Later you can replace it with Resend or a Next.js API route.
